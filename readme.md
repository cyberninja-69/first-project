This project is about monitoring staff attendance and incrementing their salary through the diam wallet by face recognition.

It uses face recognition to mark the attendance dynamically and salary is incremented using the given interval which depends.

We were unable to connect the backend to the login page which redirects us to a dashboard where a user can manage the things 
and the integration of the face recognition was not possible due to which it didn't work.


Some of the doc links were not working but tried to make a simulation of it.

This is applicable to the lectures who are attending classes and this can be used to implement in real life.

Now it is implemented for college scenario but can be implemented in general purpose also.
 We were unable to implement the face recognition in this model due to backend issues
